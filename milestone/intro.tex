Innovation is credited with creating the emerging trends in technology. It is
well established and accepted fact that patents play a crucial role in the
study of innovation and technical change~\cite{narin1987patents}. Analyzing
the patent data can help to understand the trends in technology development
and asses the innovation levels of various inventors as well as their
affiliated organizations.

Patent citations allow one to study importance of individual
patents~\cite{albert1991direct}. The inventor collaboration represents the
state of the innovation environment and the overall contribution of the
organization to the invention field. We focus our study on these two aspect of
the social network of US inventions, and propose metrics to compare the
innovative throughput of a given organization. While doing this, we carefully
account for both the qualitative as well as the quantitative impact of the
organization as a whole thus capturing the enormous heterogeneity in the value
of patents. In this project, we study the inventor and bibliometrics network
of the patents granted by United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
