\section{Project Progress and Plan}


\subsection{Progress}

%discuss why we swapped 2 and 3
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\em Data Processing:} Extract data from XML to CSV / GraphML format.

		\item {\em Inventor Disambiguation:} Run a simple pre-processing algorithm to
		generate a list of unique inventors.  This is crucial to decide on whether
		two inventors with similar names are the same person or not. item {\em
		Collaborative distance:} Calculate the shortest path of each inventor w.r.t
		to the inventor with maximum eigenvalue centrality in the whole graph. As a
		sub-activity, we plan to use three algorithms viz. Djikstra, Bellman-Ford,
		Johnson from IGraph to compare their performance.

		\item {\em Evaluation Phase I - Collaborative Distance:} Computed the
		distribution  of the collaborative distance w.r.t. Thomas Edison. Tested three
		shortest-path algorithms and analyzes their scalability with respect to the
		nature of the patent network graph.  Also checked if the overall network
		follows power law.
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Plan}

	\begin{itemize}
	%\squish
		\item {\em Organization / Assignee Disambiguation:} Run a simple pre-processing
		algorithm for disambiguating organization names. For example, IBM Corp. vs.
		International Business Machines Corporation are considered different
		organizations.

		\item {\em Evaluation Phase II - Eigenvalue centrality:} Use the Newman's leading eigenvector
		algorithm in IGraph to calculate eigenvalue centrality for each unique
		inventor with respect to patents that cite his / her patent.

		\item {\em Data analysis and comparison:} Plot the graphs for the above
		generated data and analyze the relationship between the above two
		measurements. Compare our ranking results for the most innovative organization with publicly
		available list such as Forbes list, to check if our ranking metric coincides
		with the results of other metrics.
