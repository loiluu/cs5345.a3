\section{Project Progress and Plan}


\subsection{Progress}

%discuss why we swapped 2 and 3
	\begin{itemize}

		\item {\em Data Processing:} We extract the data from raw XML to SQL and GraphML format for years 2005 to 2013, for the rest of the data, we relied on the already available processed data from Harvard.

		\item {\em Inventor Disambiguation:} We used the previously proposed pre-processing and disambiguation algorithm to
		generate a list of unique inventors.  

		\item {\em Evaluation Phase I - Collaborative Distance:} We calculated the shortest path of each inventor w.r.t
		to Thomas Edison. We used three algorithms viz. Djikstra, Bellman-Ford,	Johnson from IGraph to do this.
		We also analyzed their scalability with respect to the invention network graph and compared their performance.

		\item {\em Social Network Behavior:} Computed the distribution of the collaborative distance w.r.t. Thomas Edison for our network, and also studied if the overall network follows power law for various popularity measures.
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Plan}

	\begin{itemize}
	%\squish
		\item {\em Organization / Assignee Disambiguation:} For the next phase of evaluation, we will run a simple pre-processing
		algorithm for disambiguating organization names. For example, IBM Corp. vs. International Business Machines Corporation are considered different organizations currently. We will use a similar algorithm as for inventor disambiguation, to merge multiple assignees with such names into a single entity.

		\item {\em Evaluation Phase II - Eigenvalue centrality:} Use the Newman's leading eigenvector
		algorithm in IGraph to calculate eigenvalue centrality for each unique
		inventor with respect to patents that cite his / her patent. In this case, we do not need data before 1975, since all the patents after 1975 will be cited only by patents after 1975 (for e.g., a patent granted in 2007 will be cited only in future i.e., from 2007 onwards.), thus we do not miss any citation data.  

		\item {\em Data analysis and comparison:} Plot the graphs for the above
		generated data and analyze the relationship between the above two
		measurements. Compare our ranking results for the most innovative organization with publicly
		available list such as Forbes list, to check if our ranking metric coincides
		with the results of other metrics.
