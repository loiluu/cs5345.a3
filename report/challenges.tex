\section{Key Challenges}
	\begin{itemize}
	\squish
		\item {\em Organization Disambiguation.} Apart from inventors, organizations are also the focus of
		our study, disambiguating their names seems to be crucial as well. Hence we will
		now run a disambiguation step for the organization step before constructing
		our citation network.
		\item {\em Data Processing:} We extracted the data from raw XML to SQLite and
		GraphML format for years 2005 to 2013. For the rest of the data, we relied on
		the already available processed data from Harvard.
		\item {\em Inventor Disambiguation:} We used the previously proposed pre-
		processing and disambiguation algorithm to generate a list of unique
		inventors.
		\item {\em Organization / Assignee Disambiguation:} For the next phase of
		evaluation, we will run a simple pre-processing algorithm for disambiguating
		organization names. For example, IBM Corp. vs. International Business Machines
		Corporation are considered different organizations currently. We will use a
		similar algorithm as for inventor disambiguation, to merge multiple assignees
		with such names into a single entity.
		% \item{\em Considering time as a factor:} Optionally, we plan to study the evolution 
		% of the citation and the co-authorship network over a period of time, and if forming a 
		% link leads to increase / decrease in our measures. We have retained the time 
		% information in our data so far, but we may not be able to finish this task 
		% completely given the time constraints.
