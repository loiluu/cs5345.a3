\section{Key Challenges}
	\begin{itemize}
	\squish
		\item {\em Data Processing:} We extracted the data from raw XML to SQLite and
		GraphML format for years 2005 to 2013. For the rest of the data, we relied on
		the already available processed data from Harvard, since the data formats vary largely across years before 2005.
		\item {\em Inventor Disambiguation:} We used the previously proposed pre-
		processing and disambiguation algorithm to generate a list of unique
		inventors.
		\item {\em Organization / Assignee Disambiguation:} We ran a simple pre-processing algorithm for disambiguating
		organization names. For example, IBM Corp. vs. International Business Machines
		Corporation are considered different organizations currently. We used a
		similar algorithm as for inventor disambiguation, to merge multiple assignees
		with such names into a single entity.
		\item{\em Selecting the correct metric:} Initially, we considered Eigenvector centrality as our metric for measuring the  impact of an innovation. On further investigation, we realised that its not the apt metric, since 
		% \item{\em Considering time as a factor:} Optionally, we plan to study the evolution 
		% of the citation and the co-authorship network over a period of time, and if forming a 
		% link leads to increase / decrease in our measures. We have retained the time 
		% information in our data so far, but we may not be able to finish this task 
		% completely given the time constraints.
