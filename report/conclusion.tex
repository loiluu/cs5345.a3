\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we find that close connectedness i.e, having a small collaborative distance
 to an impactful inventor  influences the
invention impact of any inventor. Next, from our evaluation, we falsify the assumption that 
 inventors within the same organization are always closely connected as compared to
inventors from other organization. Finally, we use degree centrality i.e, the total number of citations 
as a measure of invention impact to rank the organizations. Our comparison to
available ranking of innovative organization confirms that 
total number of citations is a fair metric to use in deciding the innovation impact of organizations.
